          <p class="center">DINO WARS EPISODE I<br />DVC</p>
          
          <p>There is a place where only the most vicious go. A phantasmagorical land of pecking and savagery. A place of the past where destruction and death reign supreme. </p>
          
          <p>Welcome to the late Cretaceous. As you feel the rush of the years fade away, it’s time to stretch your Brontosaurus sized imagination into the grasps of the most feared land predator of all time: Tyrannosaurus. </p>
       
          <p>Ignore his gangly forelimbs and impress upon yourself the possibilities of havoc that might arise from a single chomp of his mighty beak. His skull is so solid that it can easily twist and pull apart a carcass, hyperextending his mandible to drop his jaw and then using his upper teeth like a hatchet to wretch off huge hunks of prey.</p>
       
          <p>However, this beast of such brute strength lacked the most crucial components of survival: foresight and intellect. Soon after reaching the peak of his physical evolution, the T-Rex ran out of prey.</p>
       
          <p>Luckily these creatures lived in packs. In desperation, a pair decided to travel throughout the seven continents, searching for the elusive taste of warm flesh. Sadly, they found nothing. In a last act of hopelessness, they set off blindly into the sea.</p>
       
          <p>After swimming for several days (which must have been rather difficult with such short arms), they stumbled upon an island. Crawling on to the shore, they smelled an unfamiliar yet tantalizing scent. Suddenly, a giant chicken appeared on the far side of the beach.</p>
